    <div id="quiz">
        <div class="question-container active" data-correct="B" data-reason="Answer B is correct. A barium enema is contraindicated in the client with diverticulitis
because it can cause bowel perforation. Answers A, C, and D are appropriate diagnostic studies for the client with suspected diverticulitis.">
            <p>1. The nurse is caring for a patient with suspected diverticulitis. The
              nurse would be most prudent in questioning an order for which of
              the following diagnostic tests?</p>
            <div class="option" data-value="A">Abdominal ultrasound</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="B">Barium enema</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="C">Complete blood count</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="D">Computed tomography (CT) scan</div>
            <p class="reason"></p>
        </div>


        
        <div class="question-container" data-correct="A" data-reason="Answer A is correct. Clients with celiac disease should refrain from eating foods containing gluten. Foods with gluten include wheat, barley, oats, and rye. The other foods
are allowed.">
            <p>2. The nurse is planning care for the patient with celiac disease. In
              teaching about the diet, the nurse should instruct the patient to
              avoid which of the following for breakfast?</p>
            <div class="option" data-value="A">Puffed wheat</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="B">Banana</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="C">Puffed rice</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="D">Cornflakes</div>
            <p class="reason"></p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-container" data-correct="A" data-reason="Answer A is correct. The nurse should reinforce the need for a diet balanced in all
nutrients and fiber. Foods that often cause diarrhea and bloating associated with irritable bowel syndrome include fried foods, caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and spicy
foods. Therefore, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.">
          <p>3. The nurse is teaching about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Which
            of the following would be most important?
             </p>
          <div class="option" data-value="A">Reinforcing the need for a balanced diet</div>
          <div class="option" data-value="B"> Encouraging the client to drink 16 ounces of fluid with
            each meal</div>
          <div class="option" data-value="C">Telling the client to eat a diet low in fiber
          </div>
          <div class="option" data-value="D">Instructing the client to limit his intake of fruits and
            vegetables
            </div>
          <p class="reason"></p>
      </div>


          <div class="question-container" data-correct="C" data-reason="Answer C is correct. Fluid volume deficit can lead to metabolic acidosis and electrolyte loss. The other nursing diagnoses in answers A, B, and D might be applicable
but are of lesser priority">
            <p>4. In planning care for the patient with ulcerative colitis, the nurse
              identifies which nursing diagnosis as a priority?
               </p>
            <div class="option" data-value="A">Anxiety</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="B">Impaired skin integrity</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="C">Fluid volume deficit</div>
            <div class="option" data-value="D">Nutrition altered, less than body requirements</div>
            <p class="reason"></p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-container" data-correct="D" data-reason="Answer D is correct. Alcohol will cause extreme nausea if consumed with Flagyl.
Answer A is incorrect because the full course of treatment should be taken. The medication should be taken with a full 8 oz. of water, with meals, and the client should
avoid direct sunlight because he will most likely be photosensitive; therefore, answers
A, B, and C are incorrect.">
          <p>5. The patient is prescribed metronidazole (Flagyl) for adjunct treatment for a duodenal ulcer. When teaching about this medication,
            the nurse would include: </p>
          <div class="option" data-value="A">“This medication should be taken only until you begin
            to feel better.”</div>
          <div class="option" data-value="B">“This medication should be taken on an empty
            stomach to increase absorption.”</div>
          <div class="option" data-value="C"> “While taking this medication, you do not have to be
            concerned about being in the sun.”</div>
